# English-Premier-League-Match-Prediction
This project explores goal-scoring patterns in the English Premier League using detailed match data from several seasons. By leveraging feature engineering and data cleaning, the dataset was transformed into a matchwise breakdown that highlights goal scorers, scoring times, and associated teams. The goal is to enable deeper analytical insights into when, how, and by whom goals are scored—paving the way for predictive modeling.

## Project Overview
The EPL Goal Scoring Insights project is a data-driven analysis of goal-scoring behavior in the English Premier League during the 2023/24 season. The raw data from football-data.co.uk was refined through feature engineering to focus on individual goal events—identifying the minute, scorer, and team for each goal across all matches.

**Key Objectives**
The main goal of this project was to go beyond basic match stats and develop a predictive system that can:

  - Predict the Full-Time Result: Whether the match ends in a Home Win, Away Win, or Draw.

  - Estimate the Final Scoreline: A likely score such as 2-1 or 1-1.

  - Provide a clear Match Outcome Statement: For example, "Fulham Win", "Arsenal Draw", etc.

These insights can help fans, bettors, and analysts anticipate match outcomes with a data-backed foundation.
